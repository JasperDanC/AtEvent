What can People do using @Event?

- Login to their @sign
- View their calendar. (week view + month view + day view?)
- Create @Events
- View their events in their calendar
- Edit Created Events
- Delete Events
- Share Events with other @signs
- Receive a shared @Event
- Accept a shared @Event (automatically gets added to receivers calendar)
( When a person shares an @Event it exists as the same event for both users,
  e.i. the creator edits a detail about the @Event it changes for all @sign holders
  who had the event shared with them )
- Decline a shared @Event ( @Event is not added to calendar and Inviter sees that it was declined )
- View who has accepted and declined shared event.
